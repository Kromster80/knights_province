3:Bandits
11:Sir, last night unknown invaders have brought death and destruction to our beloved city. The enemies were pushed back but our people need more time to improve the town's defense. The order is clear: Hold off the invaders as long as you can. We have seen a supply caravan captured by the Bandits in the North, as we moved to this location. It may improve our situation, but expect the Bandits will fight hard for it!
12:There is no need to die a worthless death in this nameless lands. Time to fallback, mylord!
