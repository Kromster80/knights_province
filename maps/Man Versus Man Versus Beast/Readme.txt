Map Story:

It was the dead of winter and the ground was covered in deep snow, but the king wouldn't listen. It didn't matter that the deserters were already ill equipped to face the winter; the king wanted their head. 

You insisted that this was deadly mission and good men would perish. The king's response was to hand you command of a large army of newly conscripted peasants. All that mattered was to save face, and punish the deserters.

Now, here you are, in the middle of a snowstorm, crossing the mountain to find a rogue bandit camp, trying to keep the peasant conscripts from being eaten by the wolves. 

What you didn't know was that the enemy king across the mountain caught word of your expedition, and sent the cavalry to crush you. When scouts come back and alert you, many men are already spread across the narrow trail, making their way across the snowy valley. 

Great. So now  you are facing a much better equipped army, trying to make a clumsy retreat with a ragtag army amid the wolves and the snow. And still no sign of the deserters... you start to think that maybe you should have joined them after all.
