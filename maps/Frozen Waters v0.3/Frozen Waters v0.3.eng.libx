1:The winter has come, my Lord, and the waters which divide us from our neighbours have frozen.|I fear that we will be attacked soon, now that the river can be more easily passed, and our allies seem to share my fear.|We should gather our troops as fast as possible and get ready for a cold and long war!||Based on my KaM map with the same name.
2:Well, don't be afraid... it's just a duck.
