1:The treasury is running on empty, the kingdom is on the brink of economic collapse. |The king has ordered you to investigate the abandoned mining colony and get it operational again.||Mine as much gold as possible in 2.5 hours
2:The treasury is running on empty, the kingdom is on the brink of economic collapse. |The king has ordered you to investigate the abandoned mining colony and get it operational again. ||You find the old watchtower, it looks like it could collapse any moment. |You fear for the state of the rest of the colony.
3:The camp seems to be only thing still standing... barely. The old watchtower collapses behind you. |There is no gold here, find the old mint in the woods to the east. Hopefully it holds enough gold to save the treasury.
4:The mint crumbles as you touch its walls. Among the ruins you find a small amount of gold with a note. ||"The king must have forgotten about us, I don't blame him. We can't produce any more gold, the outer veins of the mountain have run dry. ||However, the mountain is full of caves with gold veins flowing along its edges. I've been there, through the narrow crack just north-east of here. Too bad we lack the equipment to excavate the mountain, for its riches are immeasurable." ||It is time to go deeper.|The king has sent you some commoners, masons, and the bare essentials. |Mine yourself a way into the mountain and get the king his rightful riches.
5:It is true, the gold is there for the taking!
