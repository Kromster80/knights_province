1:On a rocky hill stood a mighty fortress—proud, with stone walls and a moat whose depths deterred any invader. For centuries, it was considered impregnable, until one night it fell victim to treachery. |The enemy, pretending to be merchants, drove carts full of barrels through the gate. ||Warriors were hidden among the goods. |When the guards closed the gates, armed attackers jumped out of the barrels and took control of the courtyard in the blink of an eye. |The surprised crew was unable to resist. ||Thus, the fortress, which had not been defeated by battering rams or fire, was conquered by treachery and deceit. |From that day on, the villagers said that the castle had fallen not because of the enemy's strength, but because of human greed and the trust that had been unwisely placed in strangers. |||[$0061FF]Special abilities:[]|[$00B3FF]Wagon - [$80ffff]equipped with explosives |[$00B3FF]Builder - [$80ffff]acquired the knowledge to bury the moat[]
2:The stone castle on the hill has long been a symbol of strength. ||Although enemies captured it years ago, they never managed to completely break the spirit of the people from the surrounding lands. |Now the time has come to reclaim it. ||The fortress is surrounded by a deep moat, and its thick stone walls seem impenetrable. ||A frontal assault would mean certain defeat, but we have no other choice, it is the only way. ||To Attack!
