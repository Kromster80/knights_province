0:Burning Hay
1:As a young and until now insignificant knight who never cared about the kingdom's politics, you find yourself pulled right in the middle of a sudden civil war.|[$00D0FF]Note:[] Fair amount of story, no tutorial. More chapters coming soon (TM).|By: [$00D0FF]Amaroth[]|Version: [$00D0FF]1.0[]
2:Chapter 1: The Peasant's Misfortune
3:1
4:Flames on the Horizon
5:You are [$00D0FF]Sir Edgar Haytow[] - and while your bloodline isn't exactly fabled - being the humble Haytow of Haytow - you were still invited to the recent royal feast. A few days later, you are returning to Haytow, your hometown...
6:Uprooting the Bandits
7:No live bandits were taken prisoner, but several fled to the North, from where they came. This means there must be a camp that needs uprooting. You put down the fires, raised the militia, charged [$0073FF]Captain Aston[] with protecting your castle (or what was left of it) in your absence, and marched after the running [$61793F]bandits[].
8:No More Maraudin'!
9:Defeating the bandits didn't only fail to be easy - it wasn't satisfying, either. While laying down their arms, it became clear that they were just poor people caught between a rock and a hard place. Their leader, [$61793F]Graham[], explained that they indeed come from [$14FF14]Duke Royce[]'s lands. A few days ago, the entire duchy was attacked. The duke's army was clearly caught off guard and pushed back, while his countryside was burnt into cinders.||Many of Royce's peasants were forced to flee, and most of them took the easiest route to the South. To your lands. With almost no food and supplies, they were first forced to beg, and then turned to banditry. While their transgressions cannot be ignored, your father always taught you to deal with the cause, rather than with the consequence. On top of that, the Duke was also your father's friend.||As such, you allied with the refugees, provided them with the supplies they desperately needed, and marched united towards their tormentors, who had sent them your way.
10:Face Me!
11:Defeating the marauders who put a torch to [$14FF14]Duke Royce[]'s lands wasn't the end of things. As the enemy town burned, you were challenged by [$000080]Lord Clifford Hargrave[], who stands behind all the raids. You refused to back down and led your troops further Northward, to face his retinue, before he can gather more strength.
12:Storming the Castle
13:You met [$000080]Lord Clifford Hargrave[]'s challenge head-on and defeated his men once again. He left his retinue behind as he fled towards [$14FF14]Duke Royce[]'s castle. [$61793F]Graham[] offered you help with the capture of the fleeing Lord. Wondering what surprises await you to the North, you sent Graham's people ahead to establish a foothold before your main force arrives with you.
