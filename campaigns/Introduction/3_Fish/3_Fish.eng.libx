2:We need food supply. Collect fish and cider.
3:There's a fishermens village nearby. They are tired of same diet and desperately ask us for some cider. They offer a deal - for every 10 cider we sent them they send us back 20 fish.
4:We have accumulated 10 extra cider. Should we send it to the fishermens village to exchange for 20 fish now?||Feel free to reopen the message and repeat the exchange command as needed!
